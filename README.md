# doordash-cli

> Cart-safe DoorDash CLI for terminal workflows.

`doordash-cli` is an unofficial CLI for the parts of DoorDash that work well in a shell: sign in once, set a delivery address, search restaurants, inspect menus and items, read existing orders, and manage a cart with JSON output.

It stops before checkout.

## Highlights

- **Cart-safe by design** — browse, inspect existing orders, and manage a cart; no checkout, payment, or order mutation.
- **Browser-first login** — `dd-cli login` reuses saved local auth or a discoverable signed-in browser session when possible, and otherwise opens a temporary login window.
- **Direct API first** — auth, discovery, existing-order, and cart commands use DoorDash consumer-web GraphQL/HTTP rather than DOM clicking.
- **JSON-friendly** — every command prints structured output.
- **Fail-closed** — unsupported commands, flags, or unsafe payload shapes are rejected.

## Install

### Install from npm

```bash
npm install -g doordash-cli
```

That installs both lowercase command names: `doordash-cli` and `dd-cli`.

Package page: <https://www.npmjs.com/package/doordash-cli>

For the full install and first-run guide, see [docs/install.md](docs/install.md).

### Install from source instead

If you want the latest unreleased work or a local checkout you can edit, use:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LatencyTDH/doordash-cli.git
cd doordash-cli
npm install
npm link
```

If you prefer to run from a checkout without linking:

```bash
npm run cli -- --help
```

### Optional runtime bootstrap

If your environment does not already have Playwright's bundled Chromium runtime installed, install it once:

```bash
doordash-cli install-browser
# or, from a checkout without linking
npm run install:browser
```

That runtime is used when the CLI needs a local browser, including the temporary login window fallback.

## First run

```bash
doordash-cli login
doordash-cli auth-check
doordash-cli set-address --address "350 5th Ave, New York, NY 10118"
doordash-cli search --query sushi
```

If you are running from a checkout without `npm link`, replace `doordash-cli` with `npm run cli --`.

## Login and session reuse

`login` reuses saved local auth when it is still valid. Otherwise it tries to import a discoverable signed-in browser session. If neither is available, it opens a temporary Chromium login window and saves the session there. If authentication still is not established, `login` exits non-zero.

`auth-check` reports whether the saved state appears logged in and can quietly import a discoverable signed-in browser session unless `logout` disabled that auto-reuse.

`logout` clears persisted cookies and stored browser state, then keeps automatic browser-session reuse disabled until you explicitly run `dd-cli login` again.

If `login` opens a temporary Chromium window, finish signing in there and let the CLI save the session. If you expect reuse from another browser, make sure it exposes a compatible CDP endpoint, then rerun `dd-cli login`.

## Command surface

### Session

- `install-browser`
- `auth-check`
- `login`
- `logout`

### Discovery

- `set-address --address <text>`
- `search --query <text> [--cuisine <name>]`
- `menu --restaurant-id <id>`
- `item --restaurant-id <id> --item-id <id>`

### Existing orders

- `orders [--limit <n>] [--active-only]`
- `order --order-id <id>`

### Cart

- `add-to-cart --restaurant-id <id> (--item-id <id> | --item-name <name>)`
- `update-cart --cart-item-id <id> --quantity <n>`
- `cart`

## Safety

The CLI allowlists browse, existing-order, and cart commands. It hard-blocks:

- `checkout`
- `place-order`
- payment actions
- order mutation or cancellation actions

Safety is enforced in code:

- unsupported commands hard-fail
- unknown flags are rejected before DoorDash work runs
- direct cart mutations use validated request shapes
- unsupported nested option transports fail closed

## Caveats

- This is an unofficial integration against DoorDash consumer-web traffic.
- DoorDash can change request shapes, anti-bot behavior, or session handling at any time.
- Review results before trusting them for anything important.
